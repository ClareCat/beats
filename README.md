Beats by ACM - Web Frontend
=============

Intro
-----
Web frontend for [Beats by ACM](https://github.com/acm-uiuc/acoustics2)

Setup
-----
First setup the backend according to its README. Then serve this repo using any means, including HTTP and locally (file://). Right now it has to be accessed with a browser on the same host as the backend server because `http://127.0.0.1:5000` is hardcoded as the endpoint base for all client requests.
